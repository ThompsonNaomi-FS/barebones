# WDV463 Deployment of Web Applications
### Naomi Thompson / Student ID: 0005007393 
 Hello, my name is Naomi. I am a student at Full Sail University living in Nebraska. With this repository I have created a static website using Hugo then pushed it to GitHub to host it using GitHub Pages with a GitHub Action pre-made workflow.
 
I live in a small village with my husband, 2 dogs, and 4 cats. I enjoy video games, anime, reading, writing, playing piano, singing, drawing, painting my nails, and creative activities in general. I would love to learn some form of martial arts and sword fighting. The Lord of the Rings trilogy are my favorite movies and I am enthralled with Tolkien's works and other people's creations inspired by him. In addition to pursuing my Bachelor's degree, I work at a Walmart as a Personal Shopper. I am also a published author and intend to fully code my own website. Until then, I am learning WordPress. Feel free to visit my website [nschmitt.com](https://www.nschmitt.com/).
